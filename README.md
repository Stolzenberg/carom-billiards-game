# carom-billiards-game
The project was created with Unity 2018.2.19f1.

This is my application test for BoomByteGames GmbH. Task was to create a singel player carom billiard game in unity. 
I leave out details here for security reasons. I am open for feedback, you can also use it if you like.

I have tried to actively use the Game Architecture with Scriptable Objects principle by Ryan Hipple.

I tried to pay attention to performance while editing the test, this is also the reason why I used more SerializeField instead of GetComponent in my scripts. I also tried to use a RingBuffer for the rewind system, feel free to give me feedback about it.
