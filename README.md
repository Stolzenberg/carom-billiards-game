# Carom billiards game
### The project was created with Unity 2018.2.19f1.
#### This is my application test for BoomByteGames GmbH. 

I have tried to actively use the Game Architecture with Scriptable Objects principle by Ryan Hipple.

I tried to pay attention to performance while editing the test, this is also the reason why I used more SerializeField instead of GetComponent in my scripts. I also tried to use a RingBuffer for the rewind system, feel free to give me feedback about it. 

## Points of interest
- Performance
- UI Elements always visible 
- Clean code without comments
- Game Architecture with Scriptable Objects
